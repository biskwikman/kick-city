# Kick City

It's like Streets of Rage but there's slider and lambrusco shops and you can go left maybe.

## How to run this bad boy

It uses the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language and the [Heaps](https://heaps.io/) game library.
It also requires the [HashLink](https://hashlink.haxe.org/) compiler. [This guide](https://heaps.io/documentation/installation.html) covers all of those things but it can still be a little confusing.

## Git flow

This is how it is set up for now:
Right now there's a master and develop branch. You can make new branch off of the develop branch when writing a new feature, and then push to that new branch on github and open a pull request to the develop branch. Then we can make a pr from the devlep branch to the master branch to update master. Might be overkill.
